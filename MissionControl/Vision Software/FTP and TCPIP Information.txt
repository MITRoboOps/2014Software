Getting Images from the BOA to the FTP Folder:

1) Find the appropriate BOA via the iDiscover tool. Then load the correct program (in this case, it should be saved as program "1").

2) Run "hercules_3-2-6" located on the Desktop. Click on "TCP Server". Make sure the "Port" under server status is 1024.

3) Run the BOA via the run continuously button (the button with two curved green arrows).

4) Everything an image is desires, type "send.namehere." without quotations. The program will then save an image into the FTP directory (located in C:\RoboFTP) with the name "namehere.0". Note, all image names will end with a 0.
